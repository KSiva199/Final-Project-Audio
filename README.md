Folders:

Audio: .wav files 


data: contains pickle files that stored ndarray data as dictionries for

      waveform
      
      spectrograms
      
      mel sepctrograms
      
      mel spectrograms that contains only the the speaking parts(cropped)
      
      mel spectrograms with fixed dimension (using SVD) of croped version.
      
mel_spectro_crop: Croped mel_spectrogrms

Audio-data-classification 1: This folder has the analysis(svm) done for fixed dimensional (using svd),cropped mel spectrograms ndarrays .


Audio-data-classification 2: This folder has the analysis for original spectrogram images using cnn and the analysis for original spectrogram ndarrays using svm.
